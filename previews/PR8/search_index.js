The density estimate is computed based on a scale estimate, which can be controlled through the scale keyword argument. Possible choices are :stdev, :iqr which uses an estimate based on the sample standard deviation or the sample interquartile range as a scale estimate. The default choice :minim uses the minimum of the above estimates. The level keyword controls the number of stages of functional estimation used to compute hatC, and can take values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, with the default value being level=2. The choice level=0 corresponds to Scott's rule under the chosen scale estimate.","category":"page"},{"location":"methods/#References","page":"Supported Methods","title":"References","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"methods/","page":"Supported Methods","title":"Supported Methods","text":"Simensen, O.
